    Used statistical measures (e.g., mean, skewness) to summarize data.

3.Visualization:
    Created scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, and histograms.
    Visualized key trends across customers and countries.

4.Key Insights:
    Identified high-value customers and regions.

Key Insights and Conclusions:-
1.A small subset of customers and countries contribute significantly to revenue.
